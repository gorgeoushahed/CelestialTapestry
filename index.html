    <h1>Solar system</h1>
            <br>
        <p>
            Our solar system is a collection of celestial bodies that orbit the sun, including eight planets, five dwarf planets, and numerous moons, asteroids, comets, meteoroids, and artificial satellites. 
            The sun, a giant star at the center of the solar system, powers the orbits of all these objects and provides the energy that sustains life on Earth. 
            Each of the planets has its own unique characteristics and features, making the solar system a diverse and fascinating place full of mysteries and wonders.
        </p>

        <h1>Inner & Outter Planets</h1>
        <br>
            <p>
                The inner planets of the solar system are those that are closer to the sun and are made up of mostly rock and metal. 
                While The outer planets of the solar system are those that are farther from the sun and are made up of mostly gas and ice. 
            </p>

        <br><br>
        <br><br>

        <h1>Other small solar system bodies</h1>
        <br>
        <p>
            This term includes objects such as dwarf planets, asteroids, comets, and other small celestial bodies that orbit the Sun. 
            These objects are typically much smaller than planets and often have irregular shapes.
            They are also often referred to as "minor planets" or "minor bodies."
